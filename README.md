# AI Defects Detection System

## Overview

This project is a Real-Time Object Detection System designed to simulate the functionality of an embedded device commonly used in factories. The system includes a Flutter mobile app that allows users to upload images or videos for object detection and classification. The system utilizes TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for object detection, and a server-based model for object classification. The main goal of the mobile app is to provide a simulation environment for testing the system's functionality with an embedded device in a factory setting.

## Flutter Mobile App for Simulation

The Flutter mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for simulating the behavior of an embedded device in a factory. The app allows users to upload images or videos, which are then processed by the system using the TFLite model for object detection. The detected objects are sent to a server for classification using a separate model. The app displays the results of object detection and classification, providing valuable insights into the simulated detection and classification process.

## Usage

To use the Real-Time Object Detection System simulation:

1. Install the Flutter mobile app on your preferred device.

2. Launch the app and navigate to the upload screen.

3. Choose an image or video to upload for object detection and classification.

4. Wait for the system to process the uploaded content.

5. View the results screen to see the detected objects and their classifications.

## Conclusion

The AI Defect Detection System simulation, implemented through the Flutter mobile app, provides a convenient way to test and experience the functionality of an embedded device in a factory setting. By utilizing TensorFlow Lite for object detection and a server-based model for classification, the app offers insights into the detection and classification process, contributing to enhanced quality control and automation in manufacturing environments.
